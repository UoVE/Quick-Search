# Quick Search
A browser extension disguised as a safety extension that allows searching Google from a popup without having to open a new window. In addition to being able to search Google through a popup, none of the searches appear in your browser history.

## Coming Soon
- Properly sized Google in iframe
- Option insert into page instead of having to open popup
- Context menu integration
